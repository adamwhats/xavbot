# XavBot

My journey into building a robot from scratch, with the initial aim of exploring the Nav2 framework. Future goals are experimenting with building my own SLAM and perception algorithms as well as Gazebo/ Isaac Sim simulation.

XavBot is a small holonomic robot based around the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX with ab Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera, RPLidar A1M8 lidar & Pimoroni Motor2040 motor control board.

## Setup Notes
### Iptables Rules
 TODO - Implement method of automatically applying the rules at /etc/iptables/rules.v4 on the jetson

### Isaac ROS Dev Environment
This codebase is designed to work in the [NVIDIA Isaac ROS Docker Development Environment](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_common/index.html). To set this up, the original files found at:
  - `src/isaac_ros_common/scripts/.isaac_ros_common-config`
  - `src/isaac_ros_common/scripts/.isaac_ros_dev-dockerargs`
  - `src/isaac_ros_common/docker/scripts/workspace-entrypoint.sh`
  
  need to be replaced with their counterparts from inside the `/home/dev/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/xavbot/xavbot_dockerfiles/isaac_ros` directory
